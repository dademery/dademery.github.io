1.Demondre Demery dademery@my.waketech.edu
2.My Github account is created for my CTI 110 class under Wake Tech Comm College
3.The repository that I created is blank as of right now because it has just been created but I am sure as time passes taking this course that it will be filled and I will be able to reflect on the changes on what was added.
4.The process that I went through to create and clone the repository was pretty simple I saved it to my documents folder because I felt like it would be the most convenient place to have it saved and the easiest thing to get too.
